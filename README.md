# ZEFI-Neophobia
This is the repository with the data from a manuscript submitted to Animal Behaviour titled "Developmental food restriction has transient effects on neophobia and fear behaviour in zebra finches."

R1 = Round 1, or behaviour trials occurring from 61-66 days post-hatch (dph).
R2 = Round 2, or behaviour trials occurring from 121-126 dph.

These data are in review, but are not yet published. Please do not use these data for your own work. Thank you in advance!
